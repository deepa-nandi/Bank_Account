A bank contains 2 kinds of accounts for customers, once called as "savings account" and the other as "current account". 
The savings account provides compound interest and withdrawal facilities but no cheque book facility.
The current account provides cheque book facility but no interest.
Current Account holders should also maintain a minimum balance and if the balance falls below that level, a service charge is imposed.

A "CLASS ACCOUNT" is created that stores customer name, account number and type of account.
From this "CLASS CURRENT_ACCOUNT" and "CLASS SAVINGS_ACCOUNT" were derived to make them more specific to their requirements.

Necessary member functions were included in order to achieve the following tasks:

1. Accept deposit from a customer and update the balance.
2. Display the balance.
3. Compute and deposit interest.
4. Permit withdrawal and update the balance.
5. Check for the minimum balance, imposed penalty, necessary, and update the balance.

No constructors were used. Member functions were used to initialize the class memebers.

THEORY:

One of the most important concepts in Object Oriented Programming is that of inheritance.
Inheritance allows us to define a class in terms of another class, which makes it easier to create and maintain an application. 
It is a procedure by which one class can acquire the property of another class.
The main class whose property is acquired is known as the "BASE CLASS".
The another class which acquires the proerty of Base Class is known as "DERIVED CLASS".
